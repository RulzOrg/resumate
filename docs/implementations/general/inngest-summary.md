# Background Processing Implementation - Complete! 🎉

## What Was Implemented

Resume uploads now process **asynchronously in the background** using Inngest. Users get instant upload success and can continue using the app while their resumes are being extracted and analyzed.

## Files Created

1. **`lib/inngest/client.ts`** - Inngest client configuration
2. **`lib/inngest/functions/process-resume.ts`** - Background job for resume processing (268 lines)
3. **`app/api/inngest/route.ts`** - Inngest webhook endpoint
4. **`app/api/resumes/[id]/status/route.ts`** - Status polling API
5. **`docs/BACKGROUND_PROCESSING.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
6. **`INNGEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## Files Modified

1. **`package.json`** - Added `inngest` dependency
2. **`.env.local`** - Added Inngest configuration (keys optional for dev)
3. **`app/api/resumes/master/upload/route.ts`** - Now enqueues jobs instead of synchronous processing

## How It Works

### Before (Synchronous - User Waits 2-4 Minutes)
```
User uploads → Extract (120s timeout) → Retry (120s) → Fallback → AI Vision → Analyze → Return
                                                                                    ↓
                                                                              User finally
                                                                              sees result
```

### After (Asynchronous - User Continues Immediately)
```
User uploads → Save to R2 → Create DB record → Enqueue job → Return SUCCESS ✓
                                                     ↓
                                                User continues
                                                using app! 🎉
                                                     
Background Job (4+ minutes, automatic retries):
  └─► Extract → Analyze → Save → Update status
```

## Benefits

### User Experience ✨
- **Instant upload** - Response in <1 second
- **No waiting** - Can add jobs, explore features immediately
- **Live progress** - Status updates via polling
- **No browser timeout** - Long extraction happens server-side

### Reliability 🛡️
- **Automatic retries** - 2 retry attempts with backoff
- **Better error handling** - Granular failure tracking
- **Job persistence** - No data loss if server restarts
- **Observability** - Full job history in Inngest dashboard

### Scalability 📈
- **Concurrent processing** - 5 resumes at once
- **Queue management** - Handle traffic spikes
- **Resource efficient** - Doesn't block API routes

## Setup Instructions

### Development (Quick Start - No API Keys Needed!)

1. **Install Inngest CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g inngest-cli
   ```

2. **Start Inngest Dev Server** (in separate terminal):
   ```bash
   npx inngest-cli dev
   ```
   Opens dashboard at http://localhost:8288

3. **Start Next.js** (in main terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Upload a resume** and watch it process in the Inngest dashboard!

### Production Setup (When Ready to Deploy)

1. Create account at https://www.inngest.com/ (Free tier: 50K steps/month)
2. Get API keys from dashboard
3. Add to production environment:
   ```bash
   INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=your_event_key
   INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=your_signing_key
   ```
4. Deploy - Inngest auto-discovers `/api/inngest` endpoint

## Testing

### 1. Upload a Resume

Visit your app and upload a resume. You should see:

**Console logs**:
```
[MasterUpload] Resume uploaded and job enqueued: { resumeId: '...', userId: '...' }
```

**Inngest Dev Server** (http://localhost:8288):
- Event: `resume/uploaded` appears
- Function: `process-resume` starts running
- Steps execute: update-status → extract-content → structured-analysis → save-results

### 2. Poll Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/resumes/YOUR_RESUME_ID/status
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": 50,
  "message": "Extracting and analyzing content...",
  "warnings": [],
  "mode": null
}
```

Status progression: `pending` (10%) → `processing` (50%) → `completed` (100%)

### 3. Check Inngest Dashboard

Visit http://localhost:8288 to see:
- **Events** - All upload events
- **Runs** - Job execution history
- **Logs** - Detailed step-by-step logs
- **Replay** - Re-run failed jobs for testing

## Processing States

| Status | Progress | What It Means | User Action |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `pending` | 10% | Queued, not started yet | Wait |
| `processing` | 50% | Actively extracting/analyzing | Wait |
| `completed` | 100% | Done! Resume ready | Use it |
| `failed` | 0% | Extraction/analysis failed | Retry upload |

## Job Configuration

- **Max concurrent jobs**: 5 resumes processing simultaneously
- **Retry attempts**: 2 (total 3 tries)
- **Retry strategy**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- **Step timeout**: No specific timeout (relies on internal function timeouts)

## Extraction Flow in Background Job

```
Step 1: Update status to "processing"
    ↓
Step 2: Extract content
    ├─► Text file? → Direct read
    └─► PDF/DOCX?
         ├─► Try LlamaParse (fast) → Success? ✓
         ├─► Try LlamaParse (accurate) → Better? ✓
         ├─► Try OSS fallback → Better? ✓
         └─► Try AI Vision → Success? ✓
    ↓
Step 3: Structured analysis (GPT-4o-mini)
    └─► Extract sections with retry logic
    ↓
Step 4: Save results to database
    └─► Update status to "completed" ✓
```

## Environment Variables

Added to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Inngest (Background Job Processing)
# For development, leave empty to use Inngest Dev Server
# For production, get keys from https://www.inngest.com/
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Testing)
1. ✅ Start Inngest Dev Server
2. ✅ Upload a test resume
3. ✅ Watch processing in Inngest dashboard
4. ✅ Poll status endpoint to see progress
5. ✅ Verify resume appears as "completed"

### Frontend Integration (To Do)
1. Update upload success UI to show "Processing..." state
2. Add polling logic to check status every 2 seconds
3. Show progress indicator (10% → 50% → 100%)
4. Update UI when status changes to "completed"
5. Show error message if status is "failed"

### Production Deployment (When Ready)
1. Sign up for Inngest Cloud
2. Add API keys to production environment
3. Deploy app
4. Monitor jobs in Inngest dashboard

## Monitoring

### Development
- **Inngest Dev UI**: http://localhost:8288
- Shows all events, runs, logs in real-time

### Production
- **Inngest Cloud Dashboard**: https://app.inngest.com
- Real-time job monitoring
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Replay failed jobs

### Database Queries

Check processing status distribution:
```sql
SELECT processing_status, COUNT(*) 
FROM resumes 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY processing_status;
```

Check failed jobs:
```sql
SELECT id, file_name, processing_error, warnings
FROM resumes
WHERE processing_status = 'failed'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
```

## Cost

### Inngest Free Tier
- **50,000 step executions/month**
- Each resume = ~5 steps
- **= 10,000 resumes/month FREE**

### When to Upgrade
- Free tier: ~333 resumes/day
- Paid ($30/month): 1,333 resumes/day
- Paid ($100/month): 6,667 resumes/day

## Troubleshooting

### Jobs Not Running

**Problem**: Resume stuck in "pending" forever

**Solution**:
1. Check Inngest Dev Server is running (dev mode)
2. Check http://localhost:8288 for errors
3. Verify `/api/inngest` route is accessible
4. Check browser console for errors

### Jobs Failing

**Problem**: All jobs fail with same error

**Solutions**:
1. Check environment variables are set (OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
2. Review Inngest logs for specific error
3. Check R2 storage configuration
4. Verify LlamaParse API key

### Inngest Dev Server Not Starting

**Problem**: Port already in use

**Solution**:
```bash
# Kill process on port 8288
lsof -ti:8288 | xargs kill -9

# Start again
npx inngest-cli dev
```
