I just spent the last 24 hours building something that would've saved me HOURS of frustration when I was job hunting...

An AI-powered Resume Health Checker that tells you if your resume will even make it past the ATS bots.

Here's what happened (and why most resumes fail): 🧵

**Tweet 2/10** (The Problem)
```
The harsh truth: 75% of resumes never reach human eyes.

They're killed by ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) before a recruiter even knows you exist.

Why? Tables. Multi-column layouts. Fancy fonts. Graphics.

All those "design improvements" are ATS poison. 💀
```

**Tweet 3/10** (Personal Story)
```
I've been there.

Spent DAYS crafting the "perfect" resume. Beautiful layout. Clean design. Skills highlighted.

Applied to 50+ jobs. Got 3 responses.

The problem wasn't my experience. It was my resume FORMAT. The ATS couldn't even parse it properly. 😤

**Tweet 4/10** (The Solution Idea)
```
So while building ResuMate AI (my AI resume optimizer), I thought:

"What if people could CHECK their resume's ATS compatibility BEFORE applying?"

Not after 50 rejections. Not after wasting weeks. BEFORE hitting submit.

That's when I started coding... ⚡

**Tweet 5/10** (Build in Public - Tech Stack)
```
Here's what I built:

✅ Public landing page (no auth needed)
✅ Drag & drop CV upload (PDF/DOC/DOCX)
✅ AI-powered ATS analysis (OpenAI GPT-4)
✅ Automated email reports via Amazon SES
✅ Score: 0-100 ATS compatibility

Tech: Next.js 14, TypeScript, AWS SES, OpenAI API

**Tweet 6/10** (The Magic - AI Analysis)
```
The AI checks for:

🔍 Parsing killers (tables, columns, text boxes)
🔍 Section structure (Contact, Experience, Education, Skills)
🔍 Keyword coverage (technical skills, industry terms)
🔍 Formatting issues (unusual fonts, headers/footers)
🔍 Content quality (action verbs, achievements)

Real analysis. Real fixes.

The trickiest part? Email delivery at scale.

I integrated Amazon SES because:
• $0.10 per 1,000 emails (vs Resend's higher cost)
• 50,000 emails/day limit (production)
• Built-in bounce/complaint tracking
• Easy AWS integration

Setting up DKIM, SPF, DMARC was... interesting 😅

## Alternative Opening (More Technical Audience)

**Tweet 1/10 (Tech Version)**
```
Yesterday I shipped a feature that solves a $100M problem:

Most resumes fail because they're optimized for HUMANS, not the ATS bots that filter 75% of applications.

So I built an AI Resume Health Checker. Here's the tech breakdown 🧵👇
