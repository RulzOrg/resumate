# Master Resume Upload Fix - Implementation Complete

## Problem

User reported only **32 characters** being extracted from resume uploads, causing the error:
```
Unable to extract enough resume content for analysis
```

## Root Cause

The application has two upload endpoints:

1. `/api/ingest/route.ts` - Updated with LlamaParse ✅
2. `/api/resumes/master/upload/route.ts` - **Still using broken extraction** ❌

The master upload endpoint (used by dashboard and onboarding) was using:
```typescript
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  prompt: `BASE64_DATA: ${base64}` // ❌ Doesn't work!
})
```

This approach **doesn't work** because:
- GPT-4o-mini text model cannot process base64 document data in prompts
- It needs vision API with proper image parts, or a document extraction service
- Result: Only ~32 characters extracted instead of full resume content

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Master Upload Route

**File**: `app/api/resumes/master/upload/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed broken `generateText()` with base64 prompt
- ✅ Added imports for `primaryExtract`, `fallbackExtract`, `ExtractResult`, `getDownloadUrl`
- ✅ Integrated LlamaParse extraction with automatic fallback
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Persisted extraction metadata to database

**Extraction Flow**:
```
Text File (.txt)
  └─> Direct read → ExtractResult

PDF/DOCX
  └─> LlamaParse (primaryExtract)
       ├─> Success with good coverage (≥60%) → Use it
       └─> Low coverage or error
            └─> Fallback to OSS extractor
                 └─> Use result with higher total_chars
```

### 2. Updated Database Layer

**File**: `lib/db.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added new fields to `updateResumeAnalysis()` type signature:
  - `warnings?: string[]`
  - `modeUsed?: string | null`
  - `truncated?: boolean`
  - `pageCount?: number | null`
- ✅ Added SQL UPDATE statements for each new field

### 3. Extraction Metadata Tracked

Now persisting to database:
- `warnings` - Array of warnings from extraction (e.g., "Low coverage: 45%")
- `mode_used` - Mode used ("fast", "accurate", "oss_fallback", "text_file")
- `truncated` - Whether document exceeded page limit
- `page_count` - Number of pages in document
- `source_metadata.extraction_mode` - Extraction mode used
- `source_metadata.extraction_coverage` - Coverage score (0-1)

## Files Modified

1. **app/api/resumes/master/upload/route.ts** (~80 lines changed)
   - Replaced extraction logic
   - Added fallback handling
   - Enhanced logging
   - Metadata persistence

2. **lib/db.ts** (~40 lines added)
   - Extended `updateResumeAnalysis()` type
   - Added SQL updates for new fields

## Testing Checklist

✅ **TypeScript compilation**: No errors  
✅ **ESLint**: Passing  
✅ **Database migration**: Completed (fields already exist from previous migration)  

🔲 **Manual Testing Required**:
1. Upload a PDF resume via dashboard
2. Check server logs for `[MasterUpload]` messages
3. Verify extraction shows full content (not 32 chars)
4. Check database has `mode_used`, `warnings`, etc. populated
5. Confirm structured analysis works with full content

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (Broken)
```
[MasterUpload] Text extraction successful, content length: 32
Master resume structured analysis failed: Unable to extract enough resume content
```

### After (Fixed)
```
[MasterUpload] Binary file detected, using LlamaParse extraction: { type: 'application/pdf', size: 124536, fileName: 'resume.pdf' }
[Extract] Starting primary extraction: { userId: 'c20c778...', mode: 'fast' }
[LlamaParse] Starting extraction: { userId: 'c20c778', mode: 'fast', fileSize: 124536 }
[LlamaParse] Extraction completed: { chars: 3847, pages: 2, coverage: 0.96, warnings: 0 }
[Extract] Primary extraction succeeded: { coverage: 0.96 }
[MasterUpload] Extraction complete: { mode: 'fast', chars: 3847, pages: 2, coverage: 0.96, warnings: 0, truncated: false }
Starting structured analysis for resume with 3847 characters
Structured analysis completed successfully
```

## Monitoring Queries

Check extraction modes being used:
```sql
SELECT mode_used, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(page_count) as avg_pages
FROM resumes
WHERE mode_used IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY mode_used
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

Check for warnings:
```sql
SELECT UNNEST(warnings) as warning, COUNT(*) as count
FROM resumes
WHERE array_length(warnings, 1) > 0
GROUP BY warning
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

Recent uploads with metadata:
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  file_name, 
  mode_used, 
  page_count, 
  array_length(warnings, 1) as warning_count,
  truncated,
  processing_status,
  created_at
FROM resumes
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Benefits

✅ **Fixes critical bug** - Users can now upload resumes successfully  
✅ **Better extraction quality** - LlamaParse with OCR support  
✅ **Automatic fallback** - Never fails completely, always tries backup  
✅ **Full observability** - Detailed logs and metadata for debugging  
✅ **Consistent architecture** - Both upload endpoints use same extraction layer  
✅ **No breaking changes** - UI and structured analysis unchanged  

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Quick fix**: Set `LLAMACLOUD_API_KEY=""` to force OSS fallback mode
2. **Full rollback**: Revert the commit:
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Code implementation complete
2. ✅ TypeScript checks passing
3. ✅ ESLint passing
4. 🔲 **Test with real resume upload**
5. 🔲 Monitor extraction logs for the next few uploads
6. 🔲 Verify database metadata is populated correctly

## Summary

The master resume upload endpoint has been updated to use the LlamaParse extraction layer, fixing the 32-character extraction bug. The implementation:

- Uses the same extraction logic as `/api/ingest`
- Provides automatic fallback to OSS extractor
- Tracks comprehensive metadata for observability
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing UI
- Passes all type checks and linting

Users should now be able to upload resumes successfully with full content extraction.
