# Foreign Key Integrity Fix & Validation Report

## Summary
- Added a resilient `ensureUserSyncRecord` helper in `lib/db.ts` to provision or update `users_sync` rows.
- Updated the resume optimization API to rely on the helper instead of raw SQL inserts.
- Ensured authenticated flows call the helper (`lib/auth.ts`) to guarantee FK integrity for every request.
- Hardened the `createOptimizedResume` database helper with automatic retry if the FK check fails on first attempt.
- Added `scripts/backfill-users-sync.ts` to populate missing user records for legacy data.

## Validation
- `npm run lint` ✅ (passes with existing warnings: `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` in `components/jobs/analyze-job-dialog.tsx` lines 173, 244 and `components/optimization/optimizer-ui-only.tsx` line 306)
- `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "Generate optimized resume"` ❌ (Next.js dev server refuses to start because middleware enforces `E2E_TEST_MODE` only when `NODE_ENV="test"`; the dev command launched by Playwright runs with `NODE_ENV="development"`).

## Next Steps
- Adjust Playwright webServer command or middleware guard to allow running tests (for example, set `NODE_ENV=test` when spawning the dev server or relax the middleware constraint in local test runs).
- After updating local data using the backfill script, re-test the full optimization flow to confirm the FK violation is resolved.
