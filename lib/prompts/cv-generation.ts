üîí IMMUTABLE FIELDS (NEVER CHANGE THESE):
${JSON.stringify(context.masterResume.basics, null, 2)}

‚ùå STRICTLY FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
1. Do NOT invent facts or add numbers unless present in EVIDENCE below
   - If original says "improved performance", you CANNOT say "improved performance by 40%"
   - If original says "led team", you CANNOT say "led team of 5 engineers"
   - If original says "managed project", you CANNOT add "$2M budget"
   - If original says "increased sales", you CANNOT add "by 25%"

2. Do NOT modify immutable fields
   - Name, email, phone, address must remain exactly as shown above
   - Education entries must remain exactly as in master (school names, degrees, dates, GPA)
   - Certification details must remain exactly as in master (names, dates, license numbers)

3. Do NOT change factual details
   - Company names, job titles, employment dates are immutable
   - Do not combine experiences from different jobs
   - Do not extrapolate beyond what's explicitly stated

‚úÖ ALLOWED ACTIONS:
1. Rephrase bullets using evidence for better impact (but same facts)
2. Reorder experiences by relevance_score (most relevant first)
3. Reorder skills to prioritize job-relevant ones
4. Promote/demote projects based on relevance to target role
5. Add skills that already appear in resume text (with justification)
6. Remove skills not relevant to job description (with reason)
7. Adjust professional summary to align with role (grounded in resume + JD)

üéØ GROUNDING REQUIREMENTS:
- Tag each bullet with grounding type:
  ‚Ä¢ "direct" = uses evidence text verbatim with phrasing changes only
  ‚Ä¢ "synthesized" = paraphrases multiple bullets without adding new facts
- Link bullets to evidence_id when possible
- Keep source_text for diff view
- Every claim must be traceable to original resume content

üîë MUST-HIT KEYWORDS (include verbatim at least once):
${mustHitBlock}
- Place them naturally in summary, skills, or relevant bullets
- Do not force awkwardly if term truly doesn't fit the candidate's experience
- Mark in must_hit_coverage where each term was placed

üîí SECTION LOCKS:
${locksBlock}

üìè LENGTH CONSTRAINTS:
- Target max ${context.options.max_pages} pages (~600 characters per page, ~50 lines per page)
- If over limit, apply trimming rules:
  1. Shorten summary to 2-3 concise sentences
  2. Remove bullets with relevance_score < 50
  3. Condense older experiences (>5 years ago) to 1-2 strongest bullets
  4. Remove secondary sections if not relevant to role
  5. NEVER trim immutable sections (education, certifications)
- Estimate final length in characters, lines, and pages

üåç SPELLING CONSISTENCY:
- Use ${context.options.keep_spelling} spelling throughout
- Examples: ${context.options.keep_spelling === "US" 
    ? "optimize, analyze, color, center, defense" 
    : "optimise, analyse, colour, centre, defence"}

üé≠ TONE AND STYLE:
- Overall tone: ${context.options.tone}
- Variant approach: ${variantInstructions[context.variant]}
- Keep bullets to 1-2 lines maximum
- Start bullets with strong action verbs
- No fluff or filler words

üîç SKILLS VALIDATION:
- Only add skills that appear somewhere in the master resume text
- Provide justification for each addition (e.g., "Found in Experience section, bullet 3")
- Provide reason for each removal (e.g., "Not relevant to target role")
- Never add skills the candidate doesn't actually have

üìä EVIDENCE AVAILABLE FOR GROUNDING:
${evidenceBlock}

üì§ OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return valid JSON matching the CvDraft schema EXACTLY. Required fields:
- basics (unchanged immutable fields)
- summary (optional, grounded in resume + JD)
- experiences (array, ordered by relevance_score desc)
- projects (optional array, promote/demote for relevance)
- volunteering (optional array)
- skills (array, reordered for relevance)
- spelling ("${context.options.keep_spelling}")
- must_hit_coverage (array showing which terms included and where)
- skills_changelog (what was added/removed with justifications)
- length_estimate (pages, lines, characters, trimmed_sections if any)
- locks_applied (confirmation of what locks were honored)

üîç QUALITY CHECKS:
- Every bullet should have evidence_id OR clear justification for synthesis
- Every experience should have relevance_score (0-100)
- All must-hit terms should appear verbatim at least once
- Skills added must exist in resume text with justification
- Length should be ‚â§ 2 pages
- Spelling should be consistent (${context.options.keep_spelling})
- No fabricated numbers, metrics, or facts`,
