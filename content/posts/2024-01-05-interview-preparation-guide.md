## Common Interview Questions

2. Relevant past experience (30 seconds)
3. Why you're interested in this opportunity (30 seconds)

### Why Do You Want This Job?

Connect your goals with what the company offers:

> "I've spent five years developing my skills in digital marketing, and I'm excited about this role because [Company] is known for innovative campaigns. The opportunity to lead the social media strategy aligns perfectly with my goal of managing end-to-end marketing initiatives."

### What's Your Greatest Weakness?

Choose a genuine weakness and show how you're addressing it:

> "I used to struggle with delegating tasks—I wanted to ensure everything was done perfectly. I've learned to trust my team by establishing clear communication and checkpoints, which has actually improved our overall output."

### Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?

Show ambition while staying realistic:

> "I want to grow into a role where I can lead larger projects and mentor others. Based on what I've learned about [Company]'s growth, I see opportunities to develop into a senior position while contributing to the team's success."

### Body Language Tips

Non-verbal communication matters:

- **Eye contact:** Maintain natural eye contact (not staring)
- **Posture:** Sit up straight, lean slightly forward
- **Hands:** Visible and relaxed (avoid crossed arms)
- **Smile:** Genuine smiles build rapport
- **Nod:** Show you're actively listening

### Virtual Interview Specifics

For video interviews:

- Test your technology beforehand
- Choose a quiet, well-lit location
- Position camera at eye level
- Look at the camera, not the screen
- Minimize background distractions
- Have a backup plan (phone number) ready

### Questions to Ask the Interviewer

Asking thoughtful questions shows engagement:

**About the role:**
- "What does success look like in this position after 90 days?"
- "What are the biggest challenges facing the team right now?"

**About growth:**

- "What career paths have others in this role taken?"

## Handling Tough Situations

### Salary Questions

If asked about salary expectations early:
