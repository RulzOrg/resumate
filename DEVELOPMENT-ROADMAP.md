## Critical Priority Tasks

### Task 1: Implement Real Usage Tracking System
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Priority**: üî¥ Critical
**Why**: Users can currently bypass subscription limits. All usage checks return mock data instead of real database queries.

**Current Issue**:
- Location: `lib/subscription.ts:121`
- Mock data used: `{ resumeOptimizations: 2, jobAnalyses: 3, resumeVersions: 2 }`
- No enforcement of Free/Pro/Enterprise tier limits

**Steps**:
1. Create `usage_tracking` table in database schema
   - Fields: user_id, action_type, timestamp, metadata
2. Add tracking functions to `lib/db.ts`
   - `trackUsage(userId, actionType)`
   - `getUserUsage(userId, period)`
3. Update `lib/subscription.ts` to query real data
   - Replace mock data with database queries
   - Add caching to avoid excessive DB calls
4. Add usage incrementing to relevant API endpoints
   - `/api/resumes/optimize/*`
   - `/api/jobs/analyze`
   - `/api/resumes/versions`
5. Test with different subscription tiers
   - Verify limits enforced correctly
   - Test edge cases (limit boundaries)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Usage tracking table created and deployed
- [ ] Real-time usage queries implemented
- [ ] Subscription limits properly enforced
- [ ] No users can exceed their plan limits

### Task 2: Test and Wire New API Endpoints
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Priority**: üî¥ Critical
**Why**: Recently implemented `/api/score` and `/api/resumes/rephrase-bullet` endpoints are untested. Step 2/3 of optimizer depends on these.

**Current Issue**:
- Endpoints exist but no integration testing
- UI not connected to new endpoints
- Risk of bugs in production

**Steps**:
1. Test `/api/score` endpoint
   - Test with various resume/job combinations
   - Verify scoring algorithm accuracy
   - Test error handling (missing data, invalid input)
2. Test `/api/resumes/rephrase-bullet` endpoint
   - Test bullet point rephrasing
   - Verify AI response quality
   - Test rate limiting
3. Test `/api/resumes/rewrite` endpoint
   - Test full resume rewrite flow
   - Verify evidence integration
4. Add integration tests
   - Create test suite in `tests/integration/`
   - Add CI/CD integration
5. Wire up to optimizer UI (Step 2/3)
   - Connect Step 2 to `/api/score`
   - Connect Step 3 to `/api/rephrase-bullet`
   - Test full 3-step flow

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All endpoints tested with various inputs
- [ ] Integration tests added and passing
- [ ] UI successfully calls endpoints
- [ ] Full optimizer flow works end-to-end

---

### Task 3: Fix React Hook Dependency Warnings
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Priority**: üî¥ Critical
**Why**: Missing dependencies in useEffect/useCallback can cause stale closures and unexpected bugs.

**Current Issues**:
1. `components/jobs/analyze-job-dialog.tsx:173`
   - Missing dependencies in useEffect
2. `components/jobs/analyze-job-dialog.tsx:244`
   - Missing dependencies in useCallback
3. `components/optimization/optimizer-ui-only.tsx:317`
   - Missing dependencies in useEffect

**Steps**:
1. Fix `analyze-job-dialog.tsx` line 173
   - Add missing dependencies or use functional updates
2. Fix `analyze-job-dialog.tsx` line 244
   - Add missing dependencies or refactor
3. Fix `optimizer-ui-only.tsx` line 317
   - Add missing dependencies or use refs
4. Run ESLint to verify all fixes
   - `npm run lint`
5. Test affected components
   - Manual testing of job analysis dialog
   - Manual testing of optimizer UI

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] No ESLint warnings for React hooks
- [ ] Components behave correctly after fixes
- [ ] No stale closure bugs introduced
