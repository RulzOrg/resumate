# Twitter Thread - ResuMate AI Build Update

---

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
Yesterday, I spent 6 hours deleting lies from my own product.

Not malicious lies. Just the harmless "+8 applications this week" sitting on my dashboard.

The problem? They were completely made up.

Here's why I ripped out all the fake data from ResuMate AI ðŸ§µ

---

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**
Most resume tools lie to you with positivity.

"85% ATS optimized!" (What does that even mean?)
"Resume score: 92/100!" (Based on what?)
"ATS-friendly!" (Did they actually test it?)

They show you green checkmarks without checking anything real.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Stakes)**
If I'm building a tool to help you land your dream job, every metric needs to be REAL.

Because fake encouragement doesn't get you hired.

Real insights do.

---

**Tweet 4 (What Changed - Part 1)**
So yesterday, I replaced all mock data with actual intelligence:

âœ… Real week-over-week tracking
âœ… Actual ATS compatibility scans
âœ… Keyword gap analysis vs real jobs
âœ… Formatting validation (bullets, dates, headings)

---

**Tweet 5 (What Changed - Part 2)**
The ATS checker now scans for things that ACTUALLY break applicant tracking systems:

â€¢ Tables & multi-column layouts
â€¢ Images & graphics
â€¢ Missing standard sections
â€¢ Excessive special characters
â€¢ Inconsistent formatting

No guessing. Real checks.

---

**Tweet 6 (The Insight)**
The keyword analyzer compares your resume to actual job descriptions you care about.

Missing React, TypeScript, and AWS?
We'll tell you.

Already have all the key terms?
We'll confirm it.

Truth > encouragement.

---

**Tweet 7 (The Progress)**
Dashboard now shows:
â€¢ Real application trends (not "+8 this week" fiction)
â€¢ Actual missing keyword count
â€¢ True ATS compatibility score
â€¢ Genuine formatting issues

When we say your resume has a problem, it's because we found a REAL problem.

## Optional engagement tweets:

**Quote Tweet Bait:**
"Most resume tools are basically horoscopes for job seekers.

'Your resume is 87% optimized!'
'Mercury is in retrograde!'

Same energy. Same usefulness."

---

**Poll Tweet:**
What matters more in a resume tool?

A) Honest feedback (even if harsh)
B) Positive encouragement (even if vague)
C) Both, but honesty first
D) Just tell me what to fix

---

**Behind-the-scenes Tweet:**
The keyword gap analyzer took 3 hours to build.

The ATS compatibility checker? 2 hours.

Figuring out how to tell users the truth without crushing their soul? Still working on that one ðŸ˜…

Building products is 20% code, 80% empathy.
