### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4 + Radix UI components
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL
- **AI**: OpenAI SDK
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Deployment**: Vercel

**Core Features:**
- Resume upload and management
- Job description analysis using AI
- AI-powered resume optimization
- Subscription management (Free/Pro plans)
- Resume version tracking
- Cover letter generation

### 📋 Next Steps

1. **Set up production environment variables**
   - Configure Clerk project and get real API keys
   - Set up Neon database and run migration scripts
   - Configure OpenAI API access
   - Set up Stripe products and pricing

2. **Database Setup**
   - Run database migration scripts in `/scripts/` folder
   - Verify all tables are created correctly

3. **Testing**
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test file upload functionality
   - Test AI integration
   - Test payment flow

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Configure domain and SSL
   - Set up monitoring and analytics

### 🐛 Known Issues (Expected)
- Build errors during static generation due to placeholder credentials (normal)
- Dynamic routes require authentication (expected behavior)
- Some dependency warnings due to version mismatches (non-critical)
