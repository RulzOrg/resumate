# PRD: Complete Resume Form Population from Optimized Markdown

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The optimized resume structured editor is currently **only populating contact information (name, email)** in the form fields, while all other resume sections (work experience, education, skills, certifications, interests) remain empty. This prevents users from editing their optimized resumes, defeating the purpose of the structured editor.

**Problem Statement:** The markdown parser (`parseMarkdownToStructured`) is incomplete and fails to properly extract all resume sections from the AI-generated optimized markdown. Additionally, certifications section parsing is entirely missing, despite the data structure supporting it.

**Business Impact:**
- Users cannot edit optimized resumes
- Data loss: Work experience, education, skills are invisible in the editor
- Poor user experience: Expected functionality doesn't work
- Wasted AI optimization: Users can't refine the generated content

## 2. Goals

1. **Complete data extraction:** Parse ALL resume sections from optimized markdown (100% coverage)
2. **Certification support:** Implement missing certifications section parsing
3. **Robust parsing:** Handle various markdown formats the AI might generate
4. **Data integrity:** No data loss during markdown → structured → preview → save cycle
5. **Debugging visibility:** Log parsing results for troubleshooting

## 3. User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**US-1: Complete Form Population**
> As a user who completed resume optimization, I want ALL my resume sections (summary, experience, education, skills, certifications, interests) to populate in the editor form, so that I can review and edit the complete optimized resume.

**US-2: Certification Editing**
> As a user with professional certifications, I want to see and edit my certifications in the structured form, so that I can include/exclude them or update details.

**US-3: Data Verification**
> As a user, I want to verify that all my work experience bullets, education entries, and skills are correctly extracted, so that I can trust the editor isn't losing any information.

**US-4: Markdown Format Flexibility**
> As a user, I want the editor to handle different markdown formatting styles that the AI might generate, so that the form always populates regardless of minor format variations.

### Secondary User Stories

**US-5: Error Recovery**
> As a user, if parsing fails, I want to see a clear error message with my original markdown intact, so that I can manually copy/paste or report the issue.

**US-6: Debug Mode**
> As a developer, I want to see console logs showing what was parsed vs what failed, so that I can diagnose and fix parsing issues quickly.

- ❌ Version history or diff comparison
- ❌ Collaborative editing

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Parser Architecture
```typescript
// Current: Imperative line-by-line parser
// Problem: Easy to miss edge cases, hard to debug

// Improved: Regex-based section extractors
const parsers = {
  summary: (markdown: string) => extractSummary(markdown),
  experience: (markdown: string) => extractExperience(markdown),
  education: (markdown: string) => extractEducation(markdown),
  certifications: (markdown: string) => extractCertifications(markdown), // NEW
  skills: (markdown: string) => extractSkills(markdown),
  interests: (markdown: string) => extractInterests(markdown),
}
```

### 6.2 Parsing Strategy
1. **Split by h2 headers** (`## Section Name`)
2. **Extract each section independently**
3. **Parse section content based on type**
4. **Merge results into final data structure**
5. **Apply defaults for missing sections**

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Parsing Improvements Needed

**Current Issues:**
- Line-by-line parsing is fragile
- No section boundary detection
- Missing certifications entirely
- Regex patterns too strict (miss variations)
- No logging/debugging output

**Solutions:**
- Extract sections by h2 headers first
- Parse each section independently
- Add comprehensive regex variations
- Implement certifications parser from scratch
- Add debug logging in dev mode

### 7.2 Test Cases Required

**Test Case 1: Complete Resume**
- Input: Full markdown with all sections
- Expected: All fields populated correctly

**Test Case 2: Minimal Resume**
- Input: Only name, email, summary
- Expected: Contact info + summary, defaults for rest

**Test Case 3: Certifications Only**
- Input: Resume with certifications section
- Expected: Certifications array populated

**Test Case 4: Format Variations**
- Input: Different bullet styles, date formats
- Expected: All variations handled correctly

**Test Case 5: Missing Sections**
- Input: No education, no interests
- Expected: Empty arrays, no errors

**Test Case 6: Malformed Markdown**
- Input: Inconsistent headers, missing bullets
- Expected: Best-effort parsing, errors logged

### 7.3 Dependencies
- Existing: None (pure TypeScript parsing)
- No new packages required

### 7.4 Performance
- Parsing happens once on component mount
- Should complete in <100ms for typical resume
- No performance concerns expected

## 8. Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
1. **Parsing Success Rate:** 100% of resumes with standard markdown format fully parsed
2. **Section Coverage:** All 7 sections (contact, summary, experience, education, certifications, skills, interests) extracted
3. **Data Completeness:** 0 fields lost during parse → display → save cycle
4. **User Satisfaction:** Users can edit complete resume without missing data

### Secondary Metrics
1. **Error Rate:** <1% parsing failures (logged and handled gracefully)
2. **Debug Time:** Reduce time to diagnose parsing issues from hours to minutes
3. **Format Tolerance:** Handle at least 5 common markdown variations per section

### Testing Checklist

## 9. Open Questions

### Q1: Markdown Format Standardization
**Question:** Should we enforce a specific markdown format from the AI optimization API?
**Options:**
- A) Yes, update AI prompt to generate consistent format
- B) No, parser should handle any reasonable markdown

**Recommendation:** Start with B (flexible parser), consider A if too many edge cases

### Q2: Certification Date Handling
**Question:** How should we handle certification expiry dates vs issue dates?
**Options:**
- A) Single "date" field (could be either)
- B) Separate "issued" and "expires" fields

**Recommendation:** A for v1 (simpler), B for v2 if users request it

### Q3: Parsing Failure UX
**Question:** What should happen if parsing completely fails?
**Options:**
- A) Show error, let user copy/paste markdown manually
- B) Show raw markdown in read-only view
- C) Fall back to plain textarea editor

**Recommendation:** A + C combo (error toast + fallback to textarea with warning)

### Q4: Debug Mode Toggle
**Question:** Should debug logs be visible in production?
**Options:**
- A) Dev only (NODE_ENV check)
- B) Hidden toggle (Shift+Ctrl+D)
- C) Always on (verbose console)

**Recommendation:** B (Shift+Ctrl+D to toggle debug overlay)

### Q5: Multiple Summaries
**Question:** Should we support multiple alternative summaries?
**Options:**
- A) Yes, up to 3 alternatives
- B) No, single summary only

**Current Implementation:** A (already supports it)
**Keep as-is**

## 10. Implementation Tasks

- [ ] **Task 2.2:** Parse certification name from various formats
- [ ] **Task 2.3:** Extract issuer organization
- [ ] **Task 2.4:** Extract date/year
- [ ] **Task 2.5:** Add certifications to form UI (already exists, just needs data)
- [ ] **Task 2.6:** Update `convertToMarkdown` to output certifications
- [ ] **Task 2.7:** Test certification round-trip (parse → display → save)

### Phase 3: Robustness & Testing
- [ ] **Task 3.1:** Create test fixtures with 10+ resume variations
- [ ] **Task 3.2:** Add error boundary around parser
- [ ] **Task 3.3:** Implement fallback to raw markdown editor on failure
- [ ] **Task 3.4:** Add debug mode toggle (Shift+Ctrl+D)
- [ ] **Task 3.5:** Add visual diff between parsed and original markdown (dev mode)
- [ ] **Task 3.6:** Load test with 100+ real optimized resumes

### Phase 4: AI Prompt Optimization (Optional)
- [ ] **Task 4.1:** Update optimization API prompt to generate consistent markdown
- [ ] **Task 4.2:** Add explicit section headers requirement
- [ ] **Task 4.3:** Request specific date formats
- [ ] **Task 4.4:** Test with 50+ optimization runs

## 11. Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Risk:** AI generates unpredictable markdown formats
  - **Mitigation:** Flexible regex patterns + comprehensive tests
  - **Backup:** Fallback to plain editor if parsing fails

### Medium Risk
- **Risk:** Performance degradation with very long resumes (10+ pages)
  - **Mitigation:** Profile parser performance, optimize if >500ms
  - **Backup:** Show loading spinner during parse

### Low Risk
- **Risk:** Special characters break parsing
  - **Mitigation:** Escape/sanitize regex inputs
  - **Backup:** Try-catch around each section parser
