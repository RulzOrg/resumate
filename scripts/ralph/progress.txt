# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Initial setup

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `@/` path alias for imports from the root directory
- Database queries and utilities in lib/db.ts
- API routes use Next.js App Router in app/api/
- UI components use Shadcn/ui from components/ui/
- Use Zod for schema validation
- Prisma schema is at prisma/schema.prisma
- Authentication via Clerk - use middleware.ts for protected routes
- Always run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before committing
